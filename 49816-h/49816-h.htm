<p>Across the straits from Gibraltar is another and very different
world. Start with Tangier (tahn-jeer´) and wander along
the Barbary coast, and you will find yourself in such contrasting
conditions, and in a civilization so different from those north of
you in Spain and in France, that it will be hard for you to believe
that you are separated from those countries by distances varying
from the narrow straits of Gibraltar to a mere matter of two or
three hundred miles.</p>

<p>You will seem to have been transported to the other side of the world.
No traveler can find greater variety in scene and life, in language and habit,
in climate and condition, than he gets in the course of a full Mediterranean
tour. Few travelers make the whole circuit of the Mediterranean. This
great inland sea is usually visited only in parts, and while the traveler is
in transit from one point to another. There is no general description
that can apply to the whole of this interesting body of water. On every
shore there is something that is new and different, and somewhere on
these shores there is something to delight each one. If scenery is desired,
the French and Italian Riviera (ree-vee-ay´-rah) will draw one irresistibly.
A life full of gaiety will hold him there. If historic associations
interest him, he will turn naturally to the shores of Italy and Greece, and
he will spend months pleasantly in the Adriatic or Ægean Sea. There
is in those countries an endless amount to learn and a wealth of natural
beauty. When you have cruised through the Ægean (ee-jee´-an), visit
the coast of Greece, and of Asia Minor. There you will know the
feelings that stirred Lord Byron
when he wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Fair clime! where every season smiles</div>
<div class="verse">Benignant o’er those blessed isles,</div>
<div class="verse">Which seen from far Colonna’s height,</div>
<div class="verse">Make glad the heart that hails the sight,</div>
<div class="verse">And lend to loneliness, delight.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Mediterranean has been
the arena of the world’s history
for several thousand years.</p>

<h3>THE MEDITERRANEAN
TRIP</h3>

<p>As your eye traces the coast
line on the map and you note the
countries whose shores are washed
by the Mediterranean, you realize
what a trip throughout that sea
must mean in instruction as well
as in delights of travel. Besides
the countries I have named,
there are Turkey, Asia Minor,
Palestine, and Egypt, to say
nothing of the great stretch on
the African coast. The shore
line is so extended, and the life
and customs at different points
vary so, that we think of the
Mediterranean as not one thing,
but many things. What is usually
called a “Mediterranean
trip” rarely comprises more than ten or fifteen points. With limited time,
the traveler naturally selects the points of which he has heard most.</p>

<h3>ALGIERS</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

<img src="images/illus04b.jpg" width="300" height="243" alt="" />

<p class="caption">ALGIERS</p>

<p class="caption"><i>A scene near the busy market.</i></p>

</div>

<p>A Mediterranean trip to many travelers means Algiers (al-jeerz´), as
far as the African coast is concerned, and the Riviera, with all the
points on that beautiful north shore line. Then they must see Naples,
of course, and after passing down the Italian coast they are likely
to go straight on to Egypt. After passing through the straits of
Gibraltar the attention of the traveler is soon centered on Algiers.</p>

<p>From the entrance to the harbor Algiers appears like a white diamond
set in a circle of emeralds. The town consists of two parts, the French
and the Arab quarters. To the visitor from the west Algiers is most interesting;
for there he meets characters of all kinds, European peoples mixing
with those of North Africa.
The French quarters show that
the Frenchman, when compelled
to live in another country,
takes a bit of Paris with
him; for there is found the
typical French café, with its
little tables on the sidewalk,
contrasting with the Arab café
where natives, in their picturesque
white costumes, sit and
sip their coffee and gossip with
wild gesticulation. Even in its
African population Algiers is
oddly mixed. Each tribe has
its own peculiar costume,
the marketplace
often looking like
a stage of a comic
opera, only much
more artistic and
natural.</p>

<p class="caption">MOSQUÉE DE LA PÊCHERIE, ALGIERS</p>

<p class="caption"><i>The “Mosque of the Fishery” was erected by Turkish architects in
1660. It is a cruciform building, with a large central dome
painted inside, and a square minaret, now a clock tower.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="caption">TOMBEAU DE LA CHRÉTIENNE</p>

<p class="caption"><i>This large tomb near Algiers, 108 feet high, was
built as a tomb for Juba II and his family.
It serves as a landmark for sailors. Its present
name is derived from the cruciform moldings
of the door panels.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The government
house, and
in fact all the
buildings except
those in the
French quarters,
are Moorish in
design and generally
whitewashed,
so that they masquerade
as glittering
white marble.
The town is beautifully situated, and is surrounded by a very interesting
country filled with relics of Punic War times, and ruins of structures
of even a more remote period. Near Algiers is the building called
the “tomb of the Christian woman.” This is really the tomb of Juba
II, who married Cleopatra Selene (se-lee´-nee), daughter of the celebrated
Cleopatra and of Marc Antony. Juba II had a son, Ptolemy, and a
daughter, Drusilla, who was the wife of Felix, procurator of Judea,
who, it will be remembered, said to Saint Paul, “Go thy way for this time;
when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee” (Acts xxiv, 25).</p>

</div>

<p>All the coast about Algiers is filled with just such interesting relics
of Biblical times. Perfect French roads now make it possible to reach
the most interesting places by carriage or motorcar.</p>

<h3>THE RIVIERA</h3>

<p>Across the Mediterranean is a stretch of shore that no traveler in Europe
should miss. It is called “The Riviera,” and it extends from Cannes
(kahn) to Ventimiglia (ven-tee-meel´-yah),
thence to
Spezia (spet´-see-ah), beyond
Genoa (jen´-o-ah);
the former section French,
the latter Italian. From one
end to the other is a chain
of health resorts, some most
fashionable, others the very
opposite; the latter on that
account more desirable to
those who wish peace and
quiet. Even in the most retired
spots, however, there
is no escape from the honk-honk
of the motorcars; for
Riviera highways are the
favorite touring roads of
southern Europe.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

<img src="images/illus06.jpg" width="300" height="208" alt="" />

<p class="caption">LOOKING TOWARD MENTONE</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Mentone belonged to Monaco until 1861. It is beautifully situated on
the Golfe de la Paix, consisting of two bays separated by a rocky
promontory.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Beginning at Cannes, the necklace of the sea contains such jewels
as Antibes (ong-teeb´), Nice (nees), Villefranche-sur-Mer (veel-frongsh-soor-mare´),
Beaulieu (bo-lee-eh´), Monaco (mon´-ah-ko), Monte Carlo,
and Mentone (men-to´-ne). These are followed by the Italian section,&mdash;Ventimiglia,
Bordighera (bor-dee-gay´-rah), Ospedaletti, San Remo
(ray´-mo), Alassio (ah-lahs´-see-o), Savona (sah-vo´-nah), Pegli (pel´-yee),
and Genoa. This section is called the Riviera di Ponente (po-nen´-teh),
followed by Riviera di Levante (le-vahn´-te) to the east of Genoa,&mdash;Nervi
(ner´-vee), Recco (rek´-ko), Santa Margherita Ligure (lih-goor´-eh),
Rapallo (rah-pahl´-lo), Sestri Levante, and Spezia.</p>

<p>The French section is more fully developed, and therefore more comfortable
and fashionable. The Italian section, while beautiful, leaves
much to be desired by the ordinary tourist.</p>

<p>There nestles in the southeast corner
of France a tiny little principality
called Monaco, the most remarkable
place of its kind in the world.</p>

<h3>MONTE CARLO</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<img src="images/illus07a.jpg" width="300" height="215" alt="" />

<p class="caption">MONTE CARLO</p>

<p class="caption"><i>The front of the Casino.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

<p class="caption">MONACO</p>

<p class="caption"><i>The palace of the Prince of Monaco, and in the background the “Tête de
Chien” or “Dog’s Head Mountain.”</i></p>

</div>

<p>It is only about eight square miles in
area, and contains nineteen thousand inhabitants.
Strange as it may seem, there
are no taxes there, as the Société des
Bains de Mer, which is simply a name
for the society or company that runs
the Casino gambling tables at Monte Carlo, pays the tribute. From
the millions of francs paid by this society to the Prince of Monaco and his
government every year, the natural inference is that most of the visitors
to Monte Carlo get nothing except experience.</p>

<p>The Casino building is very theatrical in style, built expressly for
its purpose, and superbly placed on a promontory overlooking the sea and
town. It is surrounded by beautiful gardens, carefully kept. In fact,
the whole place is a delight to the eye and the most beautiful spot on the
Riviera. It is attractive enough to detain one for days, even if the
great magnet, the Casino, were not there. On account of the gaming, the
whole district is filled with characters that one had rather not meet except
in the Casino, where perfect order is assured by the presence of numerous
detectives, ready to check disorder when it threatens, or to notify
politely anyone of suicidal
tendency to leave
the Casino and the
principality. There is
no place in the world
where arrangements
are so well planned to
satisfy the desire of
human beings to get
something for nothing.
And it is not simply
a gaming place. The
spectacle of Monte
Carlo has a great fascination
even for those
who never play at the
tables, everything is so
beautiful, so orderly,
and so well kept. Many who visit there prefer, however, to stop at
Mentone, which is but a few minutes distant by trolley or motorcar.</p>

<h3>NICE</h3>

<p>The Nicæa (ny-see´-a) of ancient times, founded by Massilians
in the fifth century B.C., Nice is the birthplace of Masséna (mah-say-nah´)
and Garibaldi, (gah-ree-bahl´-dee). Sheltered by the Maritime Alps, and
because of the great limestone cliffs along shore, which absorb the heat rays
of the sun, the temperature is so modified that flowers bloom the
year round. Nice and its near neighbors have become a famous resort
for invalids, especially of the English, who flee to this part of the
world to escape their own disagreeable winter. In summer the temperature
is fifteen to twenty degrees lower than Paris. The best
view of the town is obtained from Castle Hill, overlooking the shore of
the Promenade des Anglais, constructed by the English in 1822, in order
to give work to the unemployed. One of the secrets of the great
success of Nice as a resort is the great variety of entertainment
offered by the clever Frenchmen. Fine hotels, theaters, casinos, promenades,
and roads (the best in the world), especially the Petite and
the Grand Corniche (kor-neesh´), together with a superb climate,
are quite enough to attract people from all parts of the world.
The business part of the town is a miniature Paris. Fine avenues,
lined with shops filled with all kinds of attractive things, inveigle the
tourist into extravagant expenditure; while casinos and gambling
places relieve the venturesome of their spare cash most politely.</p>

<p>From being a republic and a great naval power in the Middle Ages,
and as such a rival of Venice, Genoa has come to be now a city of great
enterprise and activity. It stands next to Marseilles (mahr-saylz´)
in importance as a seaport. It is advantageously situated, the Gulf of
Genoa affording an attractive harbor, and the slopes of the Ligurian
hills at the back offering many spots of advantage for the display of the
city’s beautiful buildings.</p>

<p>The city is finely constructed. As you enter the harbor you find
just before you that part of the lower town that is on the level of the
water. Beyond that and up the hillslopes beautiful structures have
assembled themselves on the different levels of a great natural theater, as
if to watch your coming and to greet you on your arrival.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 289px;">

<img src="images/illus11a.jpg" width="289" height="300" alt="" />

<p class="caption">THE RAILWAY STATION, GENOA</p>

</div>

<p>On landing at the pier the traveler quickly finds himself in the attractive
Palazzo Doria, named after Andrea Doria, (do´-ree-ah) the famous
admiral of Charles V. It is well for the visitor, especially if an American,
to take this course, following up the Via Doria to the square in
front of the railway station; for there, surrounded by flowers and palms,
stands a fine monument of Christopher Columbus; who, it will be remembered,
was a native of the city. Genoa is full of stirring activity.
If you have gone there from
some of the quieter towns along
the Riviera, you will feel a
change in spirit. You are inclined
to move a little faster.
Things are happening all the
time. There is much to be
seen, and all that you see tells
a story of years of vigorous,
successful civic life. The most
notable physical features of
Genoa are its fine medieval
churches and its many splendid
sixteenth century palaces.</p>

tramway up to San Nicolo (nee-ko-lo´) and Castellaccio (cahs-tel-ah´-cho),
where you will find yourself over a thousand feet high, and
commanding a superb view of the Bisagno (bih-sahn´-yo) Valley and
the Campo Santo (kahm´-po sahn´-to) below you. The cemetery called
Campo Santo is one of the most interesting features of Genoa. It is
beautifully situated, and is filled with remarkable monuments, some of
them executed by the leading sculptors of Italy. In the burial spots of
the Genoese, as well as in the homes where they live, there is much of
luxury and elegance. In its business activities, its social life, its climate,
and its customs, Genoa
is attractive, and
holds the visitor there
for sometime content.</p>

<h3>NAPLES</h3>

<p>On the most beautiful
site in Europe
stands Naples, the
Neapolis of the Athenian
colonists. After
the Romans conquered
it, it still retained
Greek culture and institutions.
It became
the favorite summer
resort of the Romans,
and the delight of the poets Horace, Ovid, and Virgil. It was when
living in Naples that Virgil wrote his famous verses on agriculture,
the “Georgics.” After many vicissitudes Roger de Hauteville formed the
kingdom of Naples in 1130.</p>

<p>Medieval Naples is traceable
in its walls and great
gates. The Porta Capuana is
one of the best preserved.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>The market street in the old quarter.</i></p>

</div>

<p>After the young Conradin
(kon´-rah-deen), the
last of the Norman dynasty
in Naples, was executed,
the country was ruled by
the house of Anjou (English,
an´-jo; French, ong-zho´),
then by the French
(Louis XII), and then by
Ferdinand of Spain. Don
Carlos improved the city
and surrounding country. In 1806 the city was invaded by Napoleon,
who established his government there for a short time. The Bourbon
(boor-bong´) rule came to an end in 1860, when Frances II was dethroned
by Garibaldi. From the time it was founded till the present day poor
Naples has been so torn to pieces by the many nations contesting for it
that there is but little left
of its ancient beauty or
grandeur, and it now depends
upon its wonderful
situation, which, with the
beautiful places about it,
holds the visitor enchanted.</p>

<h3>THE BEAUTY OF
NAPLES</h3>

<p class="caption"><i>Capua Gate, one of the finest of Renaissance gateways, was built by the
Florentine Giuliano da Maiano, with sculptures by Giovanni da Nola.</i></p>

</div>

<p>There are travelers of
years of experience who
have declared that the site
and surroundings of Naples
are not excelled in beauty
anywhere in the world. You
enter the Bay of Naples
with the island of Ischia
(es´-kee-ah) on one side and on the other the island of Capri (kah´-pree).
Immediately before you lies Naples, stretching out from the water’s edge
up the hills beyond; the second largest city in Italy, with a population
of over five hundred thousand. Back of it and to the southeast is
Vesuvius. History has taught us to look with feelings of respect and
awe upon that smoke-crowned cone. On the shore, to the south, Herculaneum
(her-kew-lay´-nee-um) and Pompeii (pom-pay´-yee) are to be
seen, and as the coast curves out to the peninsula you come to Sorrento
(sore-ren´-to) and the road along the mountainside that takes
you on a scenic tour of
matchless beauty, including
Amalfi (ah-mahl´-fee),
Vietri (vee-ay´-tree),
and Salerno (sah-ler´-no).</p>

<p>The interest in Naples
is not only scenic, but
historic. It is not the
achievements of monarchs
nor the monuments
of artists that attract you.
In such matters Naples
is poorer than other towns
in Italy. But the relics
rescued from the explorations
in Herculaneum and
Pompeii afford an interest that is unique and compelling&mdash;an interest,
too, that is continually growing, for new discoveries are being made from
time to time.</p>

<p>Many are the scenic trips to be taken from Naples. It is a point
of departure for pleasure tourists in almost every direction. The ascent
of Mount Vesuvius is interesting; but that is the interest of curiosity.
Where visitors find the greatest happiness is in the trips to outlying
points, especially to the peninsula of Sorrento, to the island of Capri,
and to Amalfi and Ravello. It is at these points that we find the
greatest beauty of the Mediterranean. It seems indeed as if the great
inland sea and mankind had joined there to make a pleasure ground
beyond compare.</p>

<p>It is in and about Naples that the traveler will care to linger
longest. There is so much to be seen there&mdash;and, when satisfied
with pleasure jaunts and scenic trips, there is a serenity of life in
Naples, and a soft, sunny climate that, to repeat Byron’s words, “lend
to loneliness delight.” One friend of mine prolonged a trip, planned for
a week, until it filled out twelve months. There is much to interest and
delight one in all the seaport towns of the Mediterranean. After all has
been said of its varied shores, however, one is apt to conclude by giving
the palm of distinction in beauty and interest to Algiers, to Monte Carlo,
and to Naples with its environs.</p>

<p>The Mentor has reached the farm. We
have heard of its work in cities and towns
and small settlements. We have had
assurance of its acceptance by professional
men, business men, educators, reading
societies and of the place it has assumed
in the home. We have been waiting to
hear from the farm&mdash;and wanting to hear,
for it seems to us that a plan that carries
information in a popular and interesting
way to the public must be a
welcome visitor to any intelligent farm
family.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">

</div>

<p>And now comes the first voice from the
farm, and it is in its way the finest, freshest,
and cheeriest message that we have
had. It is so full of simon-pure human
notes that we are going to give it to the
readers of The Mentor in full. We are
sure it will interest all of our readers as
much as it gratifies us:</p>

<p class="noindent">“The Mentor Association, Inc., New York
City.</p>

<p>“Dear Sirs: Thank you so much for
your offer for becoming a charter member.
I think The Mentor is splendid and I desire
most keenly to accept, but alas, I am
poor. My husband and I are young and
struggling farmers. We are in a way of
becoming comfortably situated, but at
present, though we own quite a bunch of
stock, implements, some property, etc., we
really have little actual cash, and have to
plan with economy and care to make every
penny count. The grain in the bins means
money, but must pay for labor and other
expenses until another crop is harvested
next year. The cream from the cows pays
for food and clothing and incidentals.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/stars.jpg" width="100" height="19" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>“I have decided to save my dimes for
The Mentor, and to forego a renewal of
one of my magazines. My husband spends
some of his dimes for tobacco; I will save
mine for The Mentor, even if it takes
fifty, and share my joy with him. When I
read the list of previous numbers, I
longed for a complete set; but I am of a
cheerful disposition, so am consoling myself
in thinking <i>I will</i> some time have
some of them. Best wishes to you in your
great plan, and many thanks also for the
two blue coupons for my friends.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/stars.jpg" width="100" height="19" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>We have always claimed for The Mentor
a “wide human reach.” Surely it
must have it when a single number can
bring a message like this back to us from
a far western farm.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/stars.jpg" width="100" height="19" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>And now a word about the blue coupons.
They are Mentor Presentation Coupons,
and they have been prepared for the use of
members of The Mentor Association. We
believe that every member of The Mentor
Association has many friends who would
be delighted to know The Mentor, and to
become acquainted with the advantages
which the Association affords. In this
busy work-a-day world people are often
too busy to pass on a good thing to their
friends. Sometimes it is not because they
are too busy; it is simply because there
is no convenient way of passing on the
information. Some of our readers have
told us that if we would supply them with
convenient material for making The
Mentor known to others it would be
appreciated and used.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">

<p>So we have prepared the blue coupon
specially with the thought of interesting
your friends. Send to us for some of these
coupons. They will enable you to place
free copies of The Mentor with friends
that you think will appreciate them. You
enjoy The Mentor. Give your friends a
chance to enjoy it too.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">ALGIERS, ALGERIA</h2>

<p>Less than a century ago the Barbary
Coast, and the city of Algiers
in particular, was a nest of pirates.
All the principal nations of the world
paid them tribute. Their nation was
known as the “scourge of Christendom.”
Up to the year 1800 the
United States alone had poured over
$2,000,000 into the coffers of the dey, or
ruler. But it was our country, the
youngest of all, that put a stop to
this cowardly practice of paying toll
for immunity from attack on the high
seas.</p>

<p>In 1800 Captain Bainbridge, in a
United States warship, went to Algiers,
taking the usual “presents.”</p>

<p>The dey commanded him to become
his messenger and carry his despatches
to Constantinople. “The English,
French, and Spanish captains have always
done this for me. You also pay me
tribute, and you also are my slaves,” he
said insultingly.</p>

<p>Not daring to disobey without orders
from home, Bainbridge did as he commanded;
but this was too much for the
American people. After the War of 1812
Commodore Decatur served notice on
the dey that never again would the
United States pay him tribute in money.
The dey replied that some powder for his
fleet would be acceptable.</p>

<p>“The powder you shall have, if you
insist,” answered Decatur; “but the
bullets go with it.”</p>

<p>The dey refused the present; but
ordered his ships to destroy all American
shipping hereafter. These orders having
been carried out, Commodore Decatur
sailed again for Algiers, and forced the
terrified dey to sign a treaty which gave
to American ships immunity forever after.</p>

<p>In 1816 the English attacked Algiers;
but it was not until fourteen years later
that the pirates’ nest was destroyed for
good. On June 13, 1830, the dey of Algiers
slapped the French consul in the
face, and brought down upon himself the
wrath of France in the shape of an army
of forty thousand men. On the fourth
of July, Algiers surrendered, and the
“scourge of Christendom” was ended.</p>

<p>Algiers, the French capital of Algeria,
has 154,000 inhabitants. It is located on
the west side of the Bay of Algiers, and is
the most important coaling station on
the whole coast of northern Africa.</p>

<p>In Roman times the famous Biblical
town of Cæsarea occupied almost the
same site. The present city was founded
about 935; but Algiers was of little importance
until after the expulsion of the
Moors from Spain, many of whom settled
in the city. From then on until its
capture by France, Algiers was the chief
seat of the Barbary pirates. The French
have greatly improved the place.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">THE RIVIERA</h2>

<p>The Riviera is a narrow belt of coast
that lies between the mountains
and the sea all round the Gulf of
Genoa in the north of Italy, extending
from Nice on the west to Spezia on the
east. Part of the Riviera is in France
and part in Italy. The Riviera di
Ponente (“the coast of the setting sun”)
lies between Nice and Genoa. The part
between Genoa and Spezia is called the
Riviera di Levante (“the coast of the
rising sun”).</p>

<p>The climate of the Riviera is very
mild, and it is one of the most beautiful
regions on earth. All this district is
open to the south and sheltered by the
mountains on the north and east. The
landscape is delightfully varied,&mdash;here a
bold and lofty promontory, there a
wooded hill, and down near the coast
richly cultivated plains. The traveler
passes steep and frowning cliffs, whose
bases are washed by the surf of the Mediterranean,
whose summits are crowned
by the venerable ruins of towers erected
in bygone ages for protection against
pirates.</p>

<p>Many of the towns in the Riviera are
situated in fertile valleys or on picturesque
hills; while others are perched like
nests among the rocks. Little churches
and chapels peering from the somber
foliage of cypresses, and gigantic gray
pinnacles of rock frowning upon the
smiling plains, frequently enhance the
charms of the scenery; while the vast
expanse of the Mediterranean, with its
ever changing hues, dazzles the eye with
its beauty.</p>

<p>Olives, with their grotesque and gnarled
stems, are grown on great plantations in
the Riviera. The warm climate produces
luxuriant growths of figs, vines,
citrons, oranges, oleanders, myrtles, and
aloes. Bright green pine forests meet
the eye, and even palms are seen occasionally.</p>

<p>Thousands of visitors spend the winter
in the chain of towns and villages that
stretches from one end of the Riviera to
the other,&mdash;Nice; Monte Carlo in Monaco,
the little independent principality;
Mentone, the last town in the French
Riviera; Bordighera; Pegli; Nervi;
Spezia; and many others. In summer
the Italians visit these resorts for sea
bathing.</p>

<p>The only drawback to the Riviera is
its liability to earthquakes, of which there
were four in the last century alone.</p>

<p>A railway runs close along the shore
all through the Riviera. The distance
from Nice to Genoa is 116 miles, and
from Genoa to Spezia 56 miles. In the
latter stretch the railroad burrows
through the many projecting headlands
by means of more than 80 tunnels.</p>

<p>The poets Lord Byron and Shelley
both lived and wrote on the shores of
the Gulf of Spezia, and Charles Dickens,
the great English novelist, wrote his well
known story, “The Chimes,” at Genoa.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">MONTE CARLO, MONACO</h2>

<p>It is a curious thing that the smallest
country in Europe is also one of the
most visited. This is the little independent
principality of Monaco. Monaco
is only about eight square miles in
area; and it is two and a quarter miles
long. The population of the entire
principality is only 19,000.</p>

<p>Monaco&mdash;the city of Monte Carlo in
particular&mdash;is so greatly visited for two
reasons,&mdash;its charming climate and situation,
and its gaming tables. It is an excellent
health resort, but is world famous
as a gambling place. It was in 1861 that
a man named François Blanc obtained
a gambling concession in Monaco for
fifty years from Charles III. A stock
company later got hold of this concession,
and in 1898 it was extended to
1947, in return for a payment to the
prince of $2,000,000 in 1899 and another
payment of $3,000,000 in 1913. In addition
to this Monaco obtains from the
company an annual tribute of $350,000,
increasing to $400,000 in 1917, $450,000
in 1927, and $500,000 in 1937. These
great tributes make it possible for the inhabitants
of Monaco to be entirely exempt
from taxation.</p>

<p>In the principality of Monaco there
are three cities,&mdash;Monaco the capital,
Condamine, and Monte Carlo. At one
time the towns of Mentone and Roquebrune
belonged to Monaco; but they
were ceded to France in 1861 for $800,000.
The city of Monaco occupies the level
summit of a rocky headland, rising about
200 feet from the shore. Here the
prince has his palace.</p>

<p>Monte Carlo lies to the north of the
Bay of Monaco, where are gathered the
various buildings of the Casino of Monte
Carlo, with the beautiful gardens, and
many villas and hotels.</p>

<p>The history of this little principality
is an interesting one. It seems that long
ago a temple of Heracles was built on the
Monaco headland by the Phoenicians.
The same god was worshiped there by
the Greeks at a later date, and they gave
the place its name. The Grimaldis, the
present ruling family of Monaco, became
associated with the place in the
tenth century; but they did not come into
permanent possession until much later.</p>

<p>Monaco in the fourteenth century was
notorious for its piracies, and the right
to exact toll from vessels passing the port
continued to be exercised until the end
of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>For many years Monaco was an ally
of France; but in 1525 it came under the
protection of Spain. Then in 1641 Honoré
II threw off the Spanish yoke and
made himself an ally of France. The
National Convention annexed the principality
to France in 1793; but by the
Treaty of Paris in 1814 it was restored to
the Grimaldis. Finally in 1860 Monaco
passed again under French protection.</p>

<p>The present ruler of Monaco, Prince
Albert, was born in 1848 and succeeded
his father, Prince Charles III, in 1889.
The prince is absolute ruler, as there
is no parliament in the principality.
He appoints a small council to advise
him on matters of state. He also has
power to appoint the mayors and other
municipal authorities.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">NICE, FRANCE</h2>

<p>The Massilians founded Nice 2,500
years ago. Its situation soon
made it one of the busiest trading
stations on the Ligurian coast. But in
those days the price of prosperity was
continual warfare. The Saracens descended
on Nice in 729; and though at
that time they were repulsed, in the
next century they captured the city and
burned it.</p>

<p>All through the Middle Ages, Nice
had its share in the wars and disasters of
Italy. It had to fight both Genoa and
France, and on the sea its merchantmen
were attacked by Barbary pirates. Finally
in 1388 it placed itself under the
protection of the counts of Savoy. In
this way it was protected on land and
could devote its strength to taking care
of the pirates.</p>

<p>But bad fortune seemed to hover over
the city. Invading armies devastated the
land, and then pestilence and famine
raged for several years. In 1543 Nice
was attacked by the united forces of
Francis I and Barbarossa. After a brave
resistance the city was compelled to surrender,
and was pillaged by the conquerors.</p>

<p>Then followed many years of alternate
war and peace; until finally Nice was
captured in 1792 by the armies of the
French republic. It continued to be a
part of France till 1814; but at that time
it reverted to Sardinia. Then, in 1860,
by a treaty between the Sardinian king
and Napoleon III, it was again transferred
to France, in whose possession it
is today.</p>

<p>The city of Nice is a great winter resort
for invalids and others from all parts
of Europe. It is situated on the Mediterranean
100 miles east of Marseilles.
A steep limestone hill, 308 feet in height,
running back for some distance from the
shore, is the historical nucleus of the
town. It used to be crowned by a castle,
which, previous to its destruction by the
Duke of Berwick in 1706, was one of the
strongest fortresses on the coast. Now
it is a public pleasure ground.</p>

<p>Nice is a great commercial town.
Grapes, olives, oranges, and mulberries
are grown profusely, and in the city there
are perfumery factories, oilworks, furniture
factories, confectionery works, a
national tobacco factory, and many
others.</p>

<p>For the comfort and entertainment of
visitors every provision is made. Autumn
is the best season. Nice is at its
liveliest during the carnival festivities. In
these carnivals battles are waged with
sweetmeats and flowers.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">GENOA, ITALY</h2>

<p>“Seas without fish, mountains without
trees, men without honesty, women
without modesty,”&mdash;that was what
her enemies said about the republic of
Genoa in olden times. And historians
seem to agree that the character of the
Genoese in those days was not of the
best. All their energy was concentrated
on commerce and the pursuit of money.
They took no interest in art nor in any
of the intellectual development of Italy
during the Middle Ages. But these bad
traits of the Genoese have all disappeared.</p>

<p>The city of Genoa now has 275,000 inhabitants,
and is the seat of a university
and an archbishop. It is the headquarters
of the fourth Italian army corps, and
is a strong fortress, as well as being the
chief commercial town in Italy.</p>

<p>Genoa, with its many beautiful palaces,
rising above the sea in a wide half-circle,
is called “La Superba” (the superb).
The old town is a network of
narrow and steep streets, lined with
many-storied buildings; but the newer
part of the city has broad and straight
thoroughfares.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century the Genoese
built as a protection against their
enemies a rampart over nine miles long.
They also erected on the heights around
the town ten detached forts.</p>

<p>From the earliest times Genoa has
been famous as a seaport. Today it
still possesses its great mercantile supremacy,
and in addition is an important
emigration harbor. Far back in 400 B. C.
its trade with the Greeks, Etruscans, and
Celts was large, and as time went on it
increased greatly.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages the little rival
Italian states were constantly at war with
one another. Genoa had a war with
Pisa, and in 1284 shattered the power of
that city forever in a terrible naval battle
at Meloria. Then came the struggle
with Venice which ended in the defeat of
Genoa at the battle of Chioggia in 1380.</p>

<p>The city of Genoa was also filled with
internal political strife. Two or three
different factions were continually fighting
with one another, and this finally led
to Genoa’s being always under the rule
of some foreign prince. Finally in 1797
the aristocratic government of Genoa was
superseded by the democratic Ligurian
Republic, established by Napoleon, and
in 1805 Liguria was formally annexed
to the empire of France. Ten years
later it was annexed to the kingdom of
Sardinia.</p>

<p>Giuseppe Mazzini, the patriotic writer,
was born at Genoa in 1805, and Garibaldi,
the great Italian patriot and leader,
with whom he worked, though born
at Nice in 1807, was the son of a Genoese
of Chiavari.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">NAPLES, ITALY</h2>

<p>Naples, the most important seaport
in Italy, is also its largest
city. In addition to this it is one
of the most beautifully situated cities in
the world.</p>

<p>The ancient Greeks founded Naples
away back in olden times. They came
from Cumæ and founded a city which
they named Parthenope. Afterward this
was divided into Palacopolis, the “old
town,” and Neapolis, the “new town.”
It was from the second that Naples got
its name.</p>

<p>Later many other nations came into
possession of the city,&mdash;Ostrogoths, Byzantines,
and Normans. At one time
Charles of Anjou made Naples his capital.
Ferdinand I of Aragon, the Spanish
viceroy, Don Pedro de Toledo, and the
Bourbon Charles III all extended the
city. Finally in 1860 the kingdom of
which Naples was the capital was united
to the kingdom of Italy.</p>

<p>Naples has not so many historic and
artistic monuments as other Italian
cities; but in the museum are preserved
valuable treasures from Pompeii and
Herculaneum, the old Roman cities that
were destroyed by Vesuvius, and only
within recent years have been excavated.</p>

<p>The best view of Naples may be had
from the Bay of Naples. The city is
built at the base and on the slopes of a
range of volcanic hills, and rises from the
sea like an amphitheater. The Castle of
St. Elmo occupies a hill, from which a
transverse ridge runs south to form the
promontory of Pizzofalcone and divides
the city into two natural crescents. The
western part, the Chiara ward, is a long,
narrow strip between the sea and Vomero
Hill. This is the fashionable quarter.
To the east lie the oldest and busiest
quarters, of which the long Via Roma is
the main street.</p>

<p>One cannot speak about Naples without
mentioning Vesuvius. As one writer
said, “Mount Vesuvius is to the Neapolitan
bay what Fujiyama is to many a
landscape of Japan,&mdash;the lofty background
of the picture, and the grand
presiding genius of the place. By day it
proudly waves its plume of smoke, by
night its torch of fire, as if it claimed to
be the champion of destruction.”</p>

<p>A cable railway ascends Vesuvius
now, and for many years the mountain
has been quiet. But it is only slumbering.
Some day it will break loose again
and pour forth its streams of redhot
lava, its agents of destruction.</p>
